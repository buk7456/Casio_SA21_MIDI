## Casio SA-21 midi conversion
A simple project that aims to transform an old Casio keyboard into a MIDI controller, based around the Atmega328p and 
Arduino enviroment.  
It makes use of the "Hairless MIDI to Serial Bridge" for MIDI communication and "LoopMIDI" for virtual MIDI port creation, allowing for easy customization and integration into various music setups.  
Also implemented is ability for easily doing octave shift and key transpose on the fly.  
Schematics, etc, all provided.
